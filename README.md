Basic database with web-application for setting appointments.
Friend asked me to create a basic web application for him. 
- Database will collect basic user data 
  -Username/Customer name
  -Phone number
  -email
  -date and time of scheduled appointment 
- Probably will include an API that connects with Google calander
- Beyond that a profile page 
Like I said its a basic web-application, for now. If I change my mind I'll expand it from there.

I'll be using MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS/bootstrap and maybe some JavaScript.
